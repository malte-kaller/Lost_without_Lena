This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 


Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.



Below is Ulf's Code. I have no idea what it does. Ask Lena

```{r}
library(tidyverse)


#this reads in the data frame from an osf project
my_data<-read.csv("https://osf.io/4zbx2/download")

#use summarise to calculate the mean Brain Volume size and sd for each gender

my_data_mean <- 
  my_data %>% 
  group_by(SEX) %>% 
  summarise(mean_BV = mean(BRAIN_VOLUME),
            sd_BV = sd(BRAIN_VOLUME))

#plotting
#create two boxplots for brain volume for males and females
p_1<-ggplot(aes(y=BRAIN_VOLUME,x=SEX),data=my_data)+geom_boxplot()+theme_classic()+
  geom_jitter(width=.1,alpha=0.5)
print(p_1)

#calculate a new variable in my_data that gives the  BRAIN_VOLUME normalised for HEAD_SIZE

my_data <-
  my_data %>% 
  mutate(rel_BV = BRAIN_VOLUME/HEAD_SIZE)

#same plot as above only corrected for Head size
p_2<-ggplot(aes(y=rel_BV,x=SEX),data=my_data)+geom_boxplot()+theme_classic()+
  geom_jitter(width=.1,alpha=0.5)
print(p_2)

```
